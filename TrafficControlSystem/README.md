# Traffic Control System

This project involves the development of a Verilog program implemented on an FPGA board to assemble and control a traffic management system. The system integrates inputs from pedestrian buttons, vehicle sensors, and other essential components to optimize traffic flow and ensure safety. The logic developed for this system aims to enhance traffic control functionalities, ensuring efficient and responsive management of traffic signals.
